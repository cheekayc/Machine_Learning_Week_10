## In-class Exercise:

1.  What are some limitations of these data that may impact your ability
    to draw inferences from your analysis?

2.  Sketch out an analytic pipeline to address your task. Similar to
    Assignment 7, your pipeline should include the following components:

    - Data Preparation
    - Partitioning/Resampling
    - Tuning of Hyperparameters
    - Evaluation
